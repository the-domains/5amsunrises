someone once told me to always

live for the little things in life.

> live for 5am sunrises and 5pm sunsets

> where you'll see colours in the sky that don't usually belong.

live for road trips and bike rides

with music in your ears and the wind in your hair.

live for days when you're surrounded by your favorite people 

who make you realise that the world is not a cold, harsh place.

> live for the little things because they will make you realise that

> this is what life is about,

> this is what it means to be alive.
